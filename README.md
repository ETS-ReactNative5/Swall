	Swall - React Native Application
</h3>

## Overview
Swall is a drinking game application that includes 5 drinking games. The user selects one of the games and is then taking to the deck screen. Here a user will then select which decks they would like to use as part of their game, not all decks are free, the app includes in-app-purchases through the use of the RevenueCat API in which the user must pay to unlock certain decks. After selecting a deck the user is then taking to an add players screen where they can add player names or they can skip this part and head to the game. Four of the games implements the react-native-deck-swiper API to create a deck of cards feature that allows the user to swipe through the deck like a real life deck of cards.
